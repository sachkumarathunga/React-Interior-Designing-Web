          As part of a facility masterplan, IDI worked with the MCMCF to add a
          new wing to house short term rehab patients and converted more of the
          existing long-term patient rooms from semi-private to private. This
          helped transform the nursing home from its institutional days of old
          to the modern day feel of being home.

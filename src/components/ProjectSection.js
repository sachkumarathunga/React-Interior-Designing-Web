          A new dining hall offers residents a warm and welcoming place to enjoy
          a meal with family and friends. A wide open floor plan allows staff
          and wheelchair-bound residents to maneuver easily and cozy corners
          with stone fireplaces offer a quiet reprieve for guests and visitors.

          The new physical therapy gym was designed to accommodate the influx of
          short-term rehabilitation residents. It significantly increased the
          overall size of the prior therapy area and now provides plenty of
          space for residents to learn life skills, including cooking and
          self-care.
